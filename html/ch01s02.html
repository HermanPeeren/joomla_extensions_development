I am a Mechanical Engineer turned Software Engineer. I am from and still live in Greece with my wife, daughter and our two naughty cats.</p><p>I've been into computers since I was 11 years olds, at the dawn of the 1990s. Back then dinosaurs were still walking among us, haircuts were <span class="emphasis"><em>weird</em></span>, personal computers were the size of a small backpack and had <span class="emphasis"><em>far less</em></span> computing power than your average smart lightbulb. Only one of the previous statements is false. I immediately took to programming for, as I said to my parents at the time, &#8220;I want to learn how to make this machine do things for me so I don't have to do them&#8221;. LIttle did I know what I was getting myself into&#8230;</p><p>I've been using Joomla as a site integrator and extensions developer since it was called Mambo, back in 2004. I wrote my first mass-distributed extension called JoomlaPack in October 2006 while taking a two week break from my day job at the time as a business consultant. One thing led to another, JoomlaPack became Akeeba Backup and I gave up on business consultancy and mechanical engineering to become a full time software engineer.</p><p>I've been actively participating in the Joomla community since 2009. I am a regular Joomla contributor and not just writting code. I've been involved in community outreach efforts and instigated the events leading to the beginning of the Joomla 4 effort. I still contribute to Joomla and, if I want to be honest with myself, I will continue doing that until Joomla or myself is no more, whichever comes first.</p><p>I am neurodivergent (ADHD) and have a particular sense of humour. I firmly believe that life's too short to take it seriously. You'll see that a lot in this book. I don't care about writing a dry, boring book, especially on a subject as dry and boring as writing software.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="ch01s01.html"><img src="images/prev.svg" alt="Prev"></a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="ch01.html"><img src="images/up.svg" alt="Up"></a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="ch01s03.html"><img src="images/next.svg" alt="Next"></a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">1.&nbsp;About this book&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html"><img src="images/home.svg" alt="Home"></a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;3.&nbsp;New Joomla 4 features at a glance</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
