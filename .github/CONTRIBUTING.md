# Welcome to the Joomla Extensions Development book's contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to my project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [the HTML version of the book](https://www.dionysopoulos.me/book.html) and any releases I make in other formats.

Read the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

Use the table of contents icon in the top left corner of this document to get to a specific section of this guide quickly.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md).

## Getting started

There are several types of contributions possible for this project:

1. Making corrections on typos or inaccuracies you've spotted. You can either report these problems in an issue or make a Pull Request directly with your proposed changes.
2. Proposing areas of Joomla extension development which need to be covered. Please submit an issue with your suggestions. Kindly note that I am doing this on my ever-diminishing spare time, I might not be able to implement your suggestion in a timely manner (or at all).
3. Write a not yet written section. Please submit an issue first stating the section you want to write and your projected timeline. Once accepted, you can write the content and submit a Pull Request.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, please search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through the [existing issues](https://github.com/nikosdion/joomla_extensions_development/issues) to find one that interests you. If you find an issue to work on, please let me know. Once I give you the go-ahead you can make your changes and open a Pull Request with your changes.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
    - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
    - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
    - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes! To edit the XML file easily you can use the free version of the [XMLMind DocBook Editor](https://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/docbook_editor.html) (Personal Edition
   License). This kind of use is permitted as this book is distributed under an Open Source license making it an open source project for the purposes of [XMLMind's Personal License](https://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/license_xxe_perso.html).

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
  Once you submit your PR, I will review your proposal. I may ask questions or request for additional information.
- I may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on [the HTML version of the book](https://www.dionysopoulos.me/book.html) within 15' or less.
