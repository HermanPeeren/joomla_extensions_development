Please make sure that your request does NOT fall into one of the following categories:
* Help with developing or improving your own extension. This is a documentation project, not a free code review endeavour.
* Using a third party editor to edit the documentation. Please refer to its documentation.
* Converting the documentation to a different format. If all else fails you can still read it online.

Examples of valid issues:
* Offering to translate the documentation
* Making a financial contribution
* Reusing parts of the content or other clarification on its licensing
* Clarification enquiry for the code samples
* Questions while writing new content or editing existing content
