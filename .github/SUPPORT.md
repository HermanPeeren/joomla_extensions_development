## Support philosophy

This is a documentation project. By definition, documentation exists to help people understand how to do something they are unfamiliar with, or jog their memory if it's been a while since they've done it.

Documentation is ultimately an exercise in communication. It doesn't matter how well I, the documentation writer, understand the subject if I cannot convey my knowledge to you, the reader. While I've been writing documentation in a professional capacity since 2004, I will not claim to be perfect. To this end, I am willing and happy to discuss how I can best improve the documentation to convey my knowledge to you.

That said, there are a few conditions and a certain etiquette to follow to make this kind of interaction pleasant for all involved parties.

### Be respectful

Please remember that behind the screen and the keyboard there's a breathing, living human. Be respectful and kind in your interactions with me and with each other.

### We are all volunteers, we all have lives to live

I am writing this documentation book on my own spare time, without any financial or other kind of reimbursement. I am doing this because I genuinely want to help the Joomla community and, well, because I like writing.

I make a reasonable assumption that you are also here on your own spare time interacting with me and with one another because you, too, want to help the Joomla community. That's awesome and I thank you from the depths of my heart!

Do keep in mind, though, that since we're all here on our own spare time there might be a few hours, days, weeks or even months when _life_ happens. During those times we may have limited or no availability. I don't expect you to drop everything to contribute to this repository and I expect you to have the same understanding when it comes to my and other people's time as well.

### This is not a free of charge code auditing service

Please do not send me your code for review, even if you tell me that this is the code you wrote after reading the documentation I wrote. I cannot do a code review for you.

Instead, do tell me which parts of the documentation you read and what you found unclear, confusing or misleading — and _why_. This will help me improve this book for you and everyone else reading it.

### We're here to teach _and_ learn

Even though I am the one writing this documentation I do not claim to be an infallible expert in everything under the sun. 

At best, this documentation represents my subjective knowledge of how Joomla works and what I have done over the years to make my software more efficient and easier to maintain. This knowledge evolves on pretty much a daily basis. Writing this book I found out some wrongly held beliefs of mine and found, reported and fixed issues in Joomla itself — then came back to amend the book to reflect my accepted change in Joomla itself.

It's possible that I may have claimed something which is not true or which is no longer true. There might be alternative ways to do things I have not considered or simply not existed as I was writing the documentation. I may be misremembering some old discussion or event in my side notes on Joomla's history. I may have made a silly typo.

If you think I've made a mistake, please do tell me, so I can correct it.

If you have a better way to do something than what I describe, please do tell me — and why it's better. Better ideas do deserve to be in the documentation.
