# Security Policy

Throughout this documentation I am trying to give tips and best practices for helping developers create and maintain **secure** Joomla extensions.

If you have spotted something in the documentation, either the prose or the code samples, which might mislead someone into writing insecure code or is outright insecure please submit an issue using the “Something else” template. Please do try to explain the context of the security issue you found.

**Do not use issues in this repository to report security issues for Joomla itself or for my software**. 

If you want to report a security issue in Joomla itself please consult [Joomla's security policy](https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/4.2-dev/.github/SECURITY.md) for the best ways to get in touch with the Joomla Security Strike Team. I am not a part of that team.

If you want to report a security issue in my software please use [my GPG key](https://www.dionysopoulos.me/images/files/pgp_keys.asc) to encrypt your email text and submit it to [my site's contact form](https://www.dionysopoulos.me/contact-me.html).
